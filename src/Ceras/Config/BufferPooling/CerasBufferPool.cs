	/// 
	/// <para>
	/// By default Ceras does not use any pooling mechanism because incorrect usage will cause bugs and crashes.
	/// That's why Ceras uses its so called "NullPool" by default, which just calls <c>new byte[]</c> for <see cref="ICerasBufferPool.RentBuffer(int)"/>.
	/// If you want to use buffer pooling then pay close attention to the following points:

	/// 
	/// <para>
	/// In many scenarios you don't actually need a pool if you simply use <see cref="CerasSerializer.Serialize{T}(T, ref byte[], int)"/> correctly.
	/// Just have a field like 'byte[] buffer;' somewhere and pass it by ref.
	/// If its too small (or even null) then Ceras will expand the buffer.
	/// Just recycle the buffer for subsequent calls and use the return value of 'Serialize' to know how many bytes were written.
	/// </para>
	/// 
	/// <para>
	/// Most pool implementations can not handle getting a buffer returned to them that was not rented from them in the first place.
	/// So don't create a buffer using 'new byte[]' when using a pool and instead rent one from it!

	/// For a good example implementation of a pool take a look at the comments in source code of this file.
